v0.4.0 (2013-02-03)
  * The service provider now requires Predis v0.8.

  * `Predis\Silex\PredisServiceProvider` is now used only for single-client
    configurations while the new `Predis\Silex\MultiPredisServiceProvider`
    can be used to configure multiple clients. This is a breaking change from
    previous versions in which both configurations were handled by the same
    provider class.

  * Due to the nature of the above mentioned change, it is no more possible
    to define a default client when using a multiple-clients configuration.

v0.3.0 (2012-07-14)
  * Fixed service provider configuration after the recent addition of the
    `boot()` method in Silex.

  * Removed the `class_path` option, Silex removed its autoloader service and
    now relies on Composer.

v0.2.4 (2012-06-01)
  * Implemented an empty Silex\ServiceProviderInterface::boot() needed after
    recent changes in Silex.

v0.2.3 (2011-12-11)
  * There are no actual changes in the code of this release, aside from a bump
    in the required version of Predis in the composer.json file to target the
    tagged release of v0.7.0,

v0.2.2 (2011-11-13)
  * Added the ability to specify multiple clients using 'predis.clients' with
    an array of connection parameters and client options for each client.

v0.2.1 (2011-10-02)
  * Added support for Composer to manage installation and dependencies.

v0.2.0 (2011-10-02)
  * Renamed PredisExtension to PredisServiceProvider after internal changes
    in the naming of some classes and interfaces of Silex.

v0.1.0 (2011-05-07)
  * Initial release.
